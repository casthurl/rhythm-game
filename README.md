explanation of the code:

    beat keys and game settings:
we define four possible beat keys ('a', 's', 'd', 'f') and the number of beats the player will play.
reaction_time_limit is set to 0.5 seconds, meaning the player must press the correct key within 0.5 seconds of seeing the prompt.
the score_limit is how many correct beats the player needs to win.

print_intro():
this function prints out the introduction to the game, explaining how it works.

play_beat():
this function simulates a beat where a key is shown on the screen, and the player has to press the correct key within the time limit.
we check for user input by using the select.select() method, which allows non-blocking input (so the game can continue checking for input while also keeping track of time).

play_game():
this is the main function that runs the game. it randomly selects a set of beats and presents them one after another.
the game checks if the player pressed the correct key for each beat. after all the beats are presented, the game ends, and the score is displayed.

running the game:

save the script: copy and paste the script into a file called rhythm_game.py.

navigate to the directory: open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the script is saved using the cd command.

run the game: in the terminal, run the script:

python rhythm_game.py

or, if you're using python 3:

python3 rhythm_game.py
